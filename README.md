We will be making a game where the player will move around a character to move on to the next levels. 
The character will be constantly bouncing and will bounce higher up as the player moves him onto different platforms. 
If the character reaches the top of the screen, 
then the next level will start where it will become increasingly difficult for the character to get onto the next platform.
The idea for our game comes from Megajump or doodlejump.
